Open-Ended Questions: 

##Q1:
Hardware is the physical part of the matter. It includes the processor, 
RAM, and anything inside my device that responds to it. 
The second part is the kernel. This is the brain of the system. 
It controls the hardware components and tells who to operate and what to do, and starts and stops the 
process. It uses assembly language to communicate. There is another part called system calls, which 
translates the words in the shell into an assembly that the kernel can understand. 
The shell is the part where we, as users, write our commands, such as bash and other examples. 
The user space is where our commands start to be executed (these system calls work like a gateway. 
Their location is after the shell and before the kernel).


##Q2:
/  is the the  root of the operating system. It is the root of any file or directory that must be the last 
thing in its path, and any directory that has a father to this because it is the father of all.

bin, which contains the basic commands that we use to interact with the system, such as cd

sbin contains the commands that control the device itself, such as shutdown

usr, which contains the libraries that we use and operate like, for example, git

etc. This contains information about the operating system, such as the user name and device name

var is where variables are stored.

##Q3:
1-Simplify the interaction between the user space and the kernel space by providing a unified interface
2-A program is a file in which I write the operations that are supposed to be executed, 
but it is not running, meaning it is not doing any process on the CPU now. 
It is just some codes written that are not doing anything now. 
But the process is the process that consumes the CPU 
when I start running the program and the code that what i  write in the program apply  like when 
I write 1+1 in a program. As long as I do not run it is a 
program that does not run any process. 
As soon as I run the CPU, I run a process and it gives me 2
